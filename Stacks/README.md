# Stack
## <ol><li>A Stack is a _linear data structure_ which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed.</li><li>This order is called <b>Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)</b> or <b>First-In-Last-Out (FILO)</b></li></ol>

## Consider an example of plates stacked over one another. The plate which is at the top is the first one to be removed i.e. the plate which has been placed at the bottom remains in the stack for the longest period of time.

# Applications of Stacks
## <ol><li>Function Call Stacks and Recursion</li><li>Expression Evaluation - Infix, Postfix and Prefix</li><li>Depth First Search (DFS) in Graphs</li><li>Scheduling Algorithms in Operating Systems</li></ol>
