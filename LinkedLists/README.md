# Linked Lists

## A __Linked List__ is a *linear data structure in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory location.*

## A linked list is represented by a pointer to the first node of the linked list which is called *HEAD*. Each node in the list contains two parts: <br>1. DATA. <br>2. POINTER or reference to the next node.

# Advantages of Linked Lists
## Dynamic Size
## Ease of insertion and deletion

# Drawbacks of Linked Lists
## Random access is not allowed. Only sequential access is possible.
## Extra memory space for pointers.
## Not cache friendly.

# Applications of Linked Lists
## Implementing Hash Tables
## Undo Functionality Using Linked List of States
## Linked List Representation of Polynomial Expressions
## Dynamic Memory Allocation
## All Running Applications Maintained Using Circular Linked Lists
