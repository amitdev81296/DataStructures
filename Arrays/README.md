# Arrays

## **Introduction**
### An **Array** is a *collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations*. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together.

### Arrays can be used to store similar type of elements and mainly to store collection of primitive data types such as int, float, double and char and derived datatypes such as structures and pointers.

## Array Declarations in various languages

### C/C++: int a[3] = {1, 2, 3};
### Java: a = new int[20];
### Python: a = [1, 2, 3]

## Advantages of Arrays

### Allow *random access of elements*
### Better cache locality

## Applications of Arrays
### 2D Arrays used in Image Processing
### RGB is a nxnx3 array
### Speech processing where each speech signal is an array of amplitudes
### Ciphering algorithms
